# Springvale Christian Academy — Local Preview

This repository contains a single static HTML page for a school landing site.

Files:
- `index.html` — Main page (responsive, uses Tailwind CDN and Lucide icons)

Quick preview (Windows PowerShell):

1) Open in your default browser:

```powershell
Start-Process 'c:\Users\USER\Desktop\MY NEW PROJECT\index.html'
```

2) Or serve locally (recommended) using Python (works if Python is installed):

Open PowerShell, then run:

```powershell
cd 'c:\Users\USER\Desktop\MY NEW PROJECT'
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

3) Notes:
- If icons do not appear, try clearing the browser cache or open an incognito window.
- To publish, upload the folder contents to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

If you want, I can also:
- Rename the project folder, commit changes, or add a simple deploy config for GitHub Pages.
